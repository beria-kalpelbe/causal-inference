# Causal Inference 

This repository contains implementations and examples related to causal inference, focusing on understanding Berkson's paradox, modeling, and applying the Causal Inference Engine, and causal discovery using Greedy Equivalence Search (GES).

## Understanding Berkson's Paradox

Berkson's paradox is a statistical phenomenon that arises when there is selection bias in the data. This paradox can lead to incorrect conclusions if not properly accounted for in the analysis. In this project, we provide an overview of Berkson's paradox and demonstrate how to identify and mitigate its effects in causal inference.

## Modeling and Applying the Causal Inference Engine

The Causal Inference Engine is a tool for estimating causal effects from observational data. It uses a variety of techniques, including propensity score matching and inverse probability weighting, to estimate causal effects. In this project, we provide examples of how to model and apply the Causal Inference Engine to real-world data sets.

## Causal Discovery Using Greedy Equivalence Search (GES)

Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a popular algorithm for causal discovery from observational data. It is based on the principle of searching for the most likely causal graph that explains the data. In this project, we demonstrate how to use GES for causal discovery and provide examples of its application.
